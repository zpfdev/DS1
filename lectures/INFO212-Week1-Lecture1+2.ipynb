    "Welcome to INFO 212: Data Science Programming I! Starting from today, we're going to be looking at the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox. We aim to learn how to write interactive programming code for extracting, cleansing, wrangling, transforming, reshaping, and analyzing data. We will mainly use Python programming language in the Jupyter notebook environment. However, to be productive in loading, processing, and keeping track of data and analyses, we should also be proficient at using scripts such as linux command line, version control, and git. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first course in the the sequence of data science programming offering. In this course, we will cover various Python packages for high performance data analysis and visualization including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, etc. In the second course, we will study the primary python package, scikit-learn,  for building basic predictive models to solve some data challenge problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you need to create a programming environment as specified later [Set up the Development Environment](#Set-up-the-Development-Environment).\n",

    "> **Try It!** As you work through this notebook, you can run all the notebook cells (a block of either code or text). To see the markdown code in a text cell, simply double click the cell. For a code cell, you can treat it as a text editor. Running the cells by yourself would help you cement your understanding of the concepts we're talking about. Once you've written the code to in a cell, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pandas\n",
    "pandas provides rich data structures and functions designed to make working with\n",
    "structured data fast, easy, and expressive. It is, as you will see, one of the critical ingredients enabling Python to be a powerful and productive data analysis environment.\n",
    "The primary object in pandas that will be used in this book is the DataFrame, a two-dimensional tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### matplotlib\n",
    "matplotlib is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other 2D data\n",
    "visualizations. \n",

The first thing we'll need to do is to load in the libraries (we have done it in the cell above, so we don't need to repeat it). For the data set, for today, we'll be using a dataset about the Titanic passengers. The data set contains various information about passengers boarding on the Titanic ship. This data set comes from the Kaggle data science get-started competition: [Titanic Suvival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). We will use the training data set called train.csv. the extension 'csv' indicates that the data is formated as comma separated values (Hence, csv). 'CSV' files are the standard ways for save and load data in data analytics tasks.\n",
